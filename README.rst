pyseobnr provides state-of-the-art gravitational waveforms using the
effective-one-body (EOB) approach.

Installation
============

To install, you will need the following non-python dependencies:

* ``hdf5``
* ``gsl``>=2.7
* ``swig``>=4.0.1
* ``fftw3``
* ``lalsuite``


The easiest way to get these is by using ``conda``. First, create a new ``conda`` environment with

::

   conda create -n pyseobnr python=3.9
   conda activate pyseobnr
   conda install -c conda-forge lalsuite

You can install a released version of ``pyseobnr`` by running

::

   pip install pyseobnr



If installing from source,  you can do:

::

   pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
   pip install .

Installing dependencies for checks
----------------------------------

If one wants to run sanity checks in ``pyseobnr/auxilary/sanity_checks``
additional dependencies must be installed. This can be done simply by
running

::

   pip install .[checks]
